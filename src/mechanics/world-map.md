# World Map

While in [Alivarg's Sphere](../locations/alivargs-sphere.md), new icons appear under the minimap:

## Recall
Pressing the Recall icon or holding `R` for a couple of seconds warps you back to home, and safety. It can be used in any situation, even mid fight - it's better to abandon a fight than die and lose all your progress!

## World Map
Pressing the World Map icon opens the world map. The map contains buttons to warp to different areas of [Alivarg's Sphere](../locations/alivargs-sphere.md) after a few seconds cooldown. Note: some destinations have much more powerful enemies!
