# Mythfall Alerting Device (MAD)

[Mythfall Alerting Device (MAD)](https://mad.redletterday.co/)

* 🔔 Get an alert when the stability is lower than your specified threshold. A nice sound alert will play.
* 🚸 Note: the API only updates every 60 seconds, so there is a 60 second delay, but better than the 5 minute delay of the discord counter.
* 👍 Once the alert is triggered, it disables itself and must be re-enabled at a suitable level.
