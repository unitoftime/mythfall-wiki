# Swords

## General Characteristics
Most weapons that fall into this category posses the following features:
- A rather high damage in comparison to other types of weapons on the same level.
- An attack speed of avarage 2 to 2.5 attacks per second.
- Shoot two projectiles: one that dissipates after travelling very short distance and one that travels quite far.

## Types of Swords
Currently, other than the starting [Stick](./stick.md), which everyone begins their adventure with, there are only two types of swords that can be created by players, those being:
- [Normal Swords](./normalSwords.md)
- [Sais](./sais.md)
Other than those two, all other swords can only be obtained as drops from [Bosses].
