# Swords

## General Characteristics
Most weapons that fall into this category possess the following features:
- A rather high damage in comparison to other types of weapons on the same level.
- An attack speed of on average 2 to 2.5 attacks per second.
- Shoot two projectiles: one that dissipates after travelling a very short distance and one that travels quite far.

## Types of Swords
Currently, other than the starting [Stick](./stick.md), which everyone begins their adventure with, there are only four types of swords that can be created by players, those being:
- [Normal Swords](./normalSwords.md)
- [Heavy Swords](./heavySwords.md)
- [Daggers](./daggers.md)
- [The Khopesh](./khopesh.md)


Other than those, all other swords can only be obtained as drops from [Bosses]().

Those include:
- [The Cutlass](./cutlass.md)
- [The Leaf Blade](./leafBlade.md)
- [The Grug's Skull Club](./club.md)
- [The Quarterstaff](./QStaff.md)
