# Throwing Knives

Just like [Normal Swords](../swords/normalSwords.md), throwing knives are upgradeable in tiers. However, unlike [Normal Swords](../swords/normalSwords.md), the lowest tier Throwing Knife is only obtainable by defeating the boss of the dungeon [Stoneheart Forest](../../../mechanics/dungeons.md#dungeons).
