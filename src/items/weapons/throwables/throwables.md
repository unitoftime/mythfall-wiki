# Throwables

## General Characteristics
Weapons that fall into this category don't have any consistency regarding their stats or any other aspects that would affect the gameplay.
The only feature unique to this category is that their projectiles have the same sprite as the weapon itself, hence the name: "throwables".

## Types of Throwables
Currently, there are only two types of weapons in this category, both obtainable only by defeating the respective [Bosses].
Those two being:
- [The Throwing Knives](./throwingKnives.md)
- [The Shadow Shuriken](./shadowShuriken.md)

An important thing to note is, that whilst [The Throwing Knives](./throwingKnives.md) can only be obtained by defeating certain [Bosses], Player's can freely upgrade them using the appropriate resources, just like any other weapon that they can craft.
