# Resources

## General Information
Resources in Mythfall are various items, only obtainable by defeating certain [Monsters]() and [Bosses](), that players can use to craft [Armour](../armours/armours.md), [Hats](../hats/hats.md), [Weapons](../weapons/weapons.md) and [Potions](../potions/potions.md) alike.
The resources the player can obtain from each monster they kill depends on the [biome]() the said monster primarily appears in.

## Types of Resources
Resources can be used to craft many things, most of them can be used at the [Blacksmith]() located in the [hub]() in order to craft and upgrade many different types of equipment, those being:
- [Driftwood](./driftwood.md)
- [Iron Ore](./ironOre.md)
- [Chlorite Ore](./chloriteOre.md)
- [Gold Ore](./goldIre.md)
- [Cobalt Ore](./cobaltOre.md)

On the other hand, there are also some resources that can be used to craft [potions](../consumables/potions.md) at the [Apothecary]() in the [hub](), those being:
- [Green Jelly](./GJelly.md)
