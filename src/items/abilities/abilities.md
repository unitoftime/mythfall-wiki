# Abilities

## General Information
Abilities in Mythfall are equippable pieces of gear that at a cost of some [Mana]() allow the player to cast powerful spells that can either damage their foes or protect them from harm.
Every ability is seperated into three pages and the book itself. Whilst the pages have to be obtained as loot from [Bosses](), the tome has to be crafted at the [Librarian]() NPC using three pages of the same type.
The sources of obtaining the pages are as follows:
- First Pages can be obtained from easy dungeons, with a rank of one skull or less.
- Second Pages can be obtained as loot from defeating Alivarg or clearing an intermediate dungeon, with a rank of two skulls.
- Third Pages can be acquired by completing hard dungeons, with a rank of four skulls.
A very important thing to remember is that one specific dungeon can only drop one type of a page.

## Types of Abilities
Depending on the type, the ability belongs to one of the following books:
- [The Book of Flame](./bookOFlame.md)
- [The Book of Death](./bookODeath.md)
- [The Book of Life](./bookOLife.md)
- [The Book of Stone](./bookOStone.md)

## Trivia
- At one point, the developer - UnitOfTime - , had to stop all of the spellbooks from being obtainable for the purpose of reworking them. They were readded to the game and overhauled on the 24.02.2024.
