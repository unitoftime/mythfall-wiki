# Potions

## General characteristics
Potions are liquid filled vials, that upon being drunk grant the player a temporary benefit, for example a heal.
Most of the potions posses the following features:
- Can not be crafted by players, but only obtained by killing [monsters]() and [Bosses]().
- Can be upgraded at the [Apothecary]() in the [Hub]() by using a corresponding [resource](../../resources/resources.md) up to the maximum level.

Mana potions can currently not be upgraded
## Types of Potions
Currently in the game there are only 5 types of potions, with all of them granting the player a heal or some mana, depending on their level.
Those are:
- [The Cocofruit Milk](./cocofruitMilk.md)
- [The Small Health Potion](./SHPotion.md)
- [The Health Potion](./HPotion.md)
- [The Large Health Potion](./LHPotion.md)
- [The Small Mana Potion](./SMPotion.md)

A noteworty thing to mention is that the [Cocofruit Milk](./cocofruitMilk.md) is the only type of potion which can be only crafted by players.
